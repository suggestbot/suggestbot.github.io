<h1>What is SuggestBot?</h1>
<p>SuggestBot is a software component that identifies the user's needs and suggests an action, which is the key aspect of "Smart Interaction". Two key elements of SuggestBot are "context awareness" and "real-time interaction".</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p style="font-size:0.9rem">This research was supported by Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT (2017M3C4A7065955)</p>
<p style="font-size:0.9rem">이 연구는 정부(과학기술정보통신부)의 재원으로 한국연구재단-차세대정보・컴퓨팅기술개발사업의 지원을 받아 수행된 연구임(2017M3C4A7065955).</p>
<p style="font-size:0.9rem">Period : 2017.09.01 - 2019.05.31</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
